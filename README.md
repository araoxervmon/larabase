LaraBase
========

LaraBase is a starter app for speeding up the development of Laravel projects. With basic knowledge of Laravel, LaraBase can be adapted and customized to your needs. The frontend of LaraBase was built with Bootstrap 3 and the authentican system was built in such a way that you could use it right away or modify AuthController.php to change the control flow. As far as possible, external packages were not used with the exception of [Generators](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Laravel-4-Generators) and [Debugbar](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar)

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1 - Get LaraBase
**Option 1**: [Download LaraBase](https://github.com/chiraggude/larabase/archive/master.zip) and unzip it (remember to rename the folder to larabase)

**Option 2**: Git Clone `git clone https://github.com/chiraggude/larabase.git larabase`

### Step 2: Use Composer to install dependencies: 
```
cd larabase
composer install
```
### Step 3: Configure app Settings
**Database**: Create a new database and change the appropriate settings in `/app/config/database.php`

**Mail**: Configure your mail settings in `/app/config/mail.php`

### Step 4: Database Migrations and Seeding
Setup migrations table in DB: `php artisan migrate`

Seed the database: `php artisan db:seed`

### Step 5: Setup Development Tools (optional)
Autoload the following Service Providers in `/app/config/app.php`
```
'Way\Generators\GeneratorsServiceProvider',
'Barryvdh\Debugbar\ServiceProvider',
```
It is good practice to maintain different configurations for Local Development, Staging and Production. To set this up, read this short guide: [Configurations & Environments](https://github.com/chiraggude/larabase/wiki/Development-Environments-and-Configuration-in-Laravel)

### Step 6: Start using LaraBase
LaraBase Login: [http://localhost/larabase/public](http://localhost/larabase/public)

If you have seeded the database, you can Login at: [http://localhost/larabase/public/login](http://localhost/larabase/public/login)
