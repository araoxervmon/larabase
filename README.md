LaraBase
========

LaraBase is a starter app for speeding up the development of Laravel projects. With basic knowledge of Laravel, LaraBase can be adapted and customized to your needs. The frontend of LaraBase is built with Bootstrap 3.1.1 and the authentican system was built in such a way that you could use it right away or modify AuthController.php to change the control flow. As far as possible, external packages were not used with the exception of [Generators](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Laravel-4-Generators)

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1 - Get LaraBase
**Option 1**: [Download LaraBase](https://github.com/chiraggude/larabase/archive/master.zip) and unzip it (remember to rename the folder to larabase)

**Option 2**: Git Clone `git clone https://github.com/chiraggude/larabase.git larabase`

### Step 2: Use Composer to install dependencies: 
```
cd larabase
composer install
```
### Step 3: Configure Settings

By default, LaraBase's environment is set to `local`, so all configurations in `/app/config/local/` will take precedence over configurations in `/app/config/`.

**Step 1**: Copy **app.php**, **database.php**, **mail.php** and **larabase.php** from `/app/config/` to `/app/config/local`

**Step 2**: Create a new database on your machine and change the appropriate settings in `/app/config/local/database.php`

**Step 3**: Configure your mail settings in `/app/config/local/mail.php`

**Step 4**:  Configure your LaraBase specific settings in `/app/config/local/larabase.php`

### Step 4: Database Migrations and Seeding
Setup migrations table in DB: `php artisan migrate`

Seed the database: `php artisan db:seed`

### Step 5: Setup Development Tools (optional)
Add the following line to the list of autoloaded Service Providers in `/app/config/local/app.php`
```
'Way\Generators\GeneratorsServiceProvider',
```

### Step 6: Start using LaraBase
LaraBase: [http://localhost/larabase/public](http://localhost/larabase/public)
