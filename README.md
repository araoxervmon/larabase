LaraBase
========

> LaraBase is a starter app for speeding up the development of Laravel projects. Most SaaS apps require user authentication, email activation, feedback form, dashboard, user profiles, setting, blog etc. With basic knowledge of Laravel's conventions, LaraBase can be adapted and customized to your needs. The frontend is built with Bootstrap 3.3 and this codebase includes the JeffreyWay/Laravel-4-Generators package as a dev-dependency.

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1 - Get LaraBase
**Option 1**: [Download LaraBase](https://github.com/chiraggude/larabase/archive/master.zip) and unzip it (remember to rename the folder to larabase)

**Option 2**: Git Clone `git clone https://github.com/chiraggude/larabase.git larabase`

### Step 2: Use Composer to install dependencies: 
```
cd larabase
composer install
```
### Step 3: Configure Settings

By default, LaraBase's environment is set to `local`, so all configurations in `/app/config/local/` will take precedence over configurations in `/app/config/`.

**Step A**: Copy **app.php**, **database.php**, **mail.php** and **larabase.php** from `/app/config/` to `/app/config/local`

**Step B**: Configure App settings in `/app/config/local/app.php`. Add your app encryption `key` and set `debug` to `true`

**Step C**: Create a new database on your machine and change the appropriate settings in `/app/config/local/database.php`

**Step D**: Configure your mail settings in `/app/config/local/mail.php`

**Step E**:  Configure your LaraBase specific settings in `/app/config/local/larabase.php`
